            After watching PayPal become the premier choice of Internet auction shoppers,
            online marketplace giant eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion in October 2002. 
            The company offers users the ability to link their PayPal accounts to their own
            bank accounts, making transfers and payments more efficient than money orders or checks.
            Fees are collected by eBay on certain transactions and are determined based on the amount
            of the transaction, the nature of the transaction, and the currency type of the transaction
            In 2015 PayPal was spun off into an independent company, but it continued to be used by eBay.
            A sophisticated series of security advancements helped PayPal remain a respected company in
            terms of identity theft prevention. The company implemented superior anti-phishing and anti-hacking
            measures, and it developed a portable “key” device that requires manual activation before a transfer
            from a PayPal account is processed. PayPal allows consumers to contest and request a refund in transactions
            where they have been misled or cheated. Additionally, PayPal offers a type of limited protection for sellers
            and includes a system that deactivates accounts when suspicious or excessive activity is observed.
